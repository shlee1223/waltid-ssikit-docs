# Dynamic/Custom Policies

SSI Kit supports custom policies, written in any of the supported policy engine languages. A dynamic policy can either be executed on the fly (if all required parameters are provided) or saved under a specific name for later reference in the verify command or REST API.

{% hint style="danger" %}
_Note: To use dynamic policies with Open Policy Agent, setup of the OPA Engine is required. Refer to the_ [_OPA Engine configuration_](../../../usage-examples/open-policy-agent/configure-opa-engine.md) _for more details._
{% endhint %}
