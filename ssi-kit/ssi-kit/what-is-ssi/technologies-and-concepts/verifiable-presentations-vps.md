# Verifiable Presentations (VPs)

A Verifiable Presentation (VP) is a collection from one or more Verifiable Credentials, whereas the authorship of the whole collection can be cryptographically verified. VPs are standardized as part of the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations).

## Why do we need Verifiable Presentations?

Verifiable Presentations, make it possible to combine and tamper-evident share data of one or more Verifiable Credentials. The shared presentation of the data will be encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. In situations where only a subset of the original Verifiable Credential data is reveled, for example, to enhance user privacy, [Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs) can help us keep that data verifiable.

## How Verifiable Presentations are composed?

**Verifiable Presentations** represent a composition of claims, which can come from one or multiple Verifiable Credentials, of which the authorship is verified. This **gives the holder of credentials the chance of composing context specify presentations**, which only contain the data which is relevant in that context. When presenting the composition to a verifier, it can easily be validated.

Taking a closer look at how they are built up. We will see four different layers:

1. **Presentation Layer  -**  Being the Verifiable Presentation itself with the required metadata
2. **Credential Layer -** Referenced by Layer 1 and pointing to one or more credentials
3. **Credential Proof Layer -** Holding the proofs of the credentials and the signatures from Layer
4. **Presentation Proof Layer -** Holding the proof of the Verifiable Presentation and its signatures
