# Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital identity documents that can easily and securely be shared with and verified (incl. validity, integrity, authenticity, provenance) by anyone in a privacy preserving way. Importantly, they are never (!) stored on a blockchain due to privacy and compliance reasons.

The SSI Kit supports W3C Verifiable Credentials in different formats:

* JSON / JWT
* JSON-LD

_Note that we are continuously adding support for new VC types and formats._

You can learn more about VCs [here](https://docs.walt.id/v/ssikit/ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/technologies-and-concepts#verifiable-credentials-vcs-and-verifiable-presentations-vps).
