# Functionality

The SSI Kit establishes an identity infrastructure layer for any use case in any industry. Its core services are in the scope of:

* **Registry Interactions** (e.g. read, write; agnostic towards the underlying tech e.g. DLT, DNS)
* **Key Management** (e.g. generate, sign, import, export, manage lifecycle)
* **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** operations (e.g. register, resolve, manage lifecycle)
* **Verifiable Credential/Presentations (VC, VP)** operations (e.g. create, issue, present, verify)
* **Ecosystem specific use cases** (e.g. onboarding, data exchange and monetization)
