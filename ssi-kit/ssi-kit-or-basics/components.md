# Components

## Signatory | For Issuers

Signatory allows you to digitize paper credentials and automate data provision to your stakeholders.

It provides all functionality required by “Issuers”. For example:

* Process and authenticate data requests by people or organisations,
* Import data (from local storage or third parties),
* Create re-usable VC templates,
* Create VCs in different formats (e.g. JSON/JWT, JSON-LD),
* Sign VCs using different key types (e.g. ed25519, secp256K1, RSA),
* Manage the lifecycle of VCs (e.g. revocation).
* Issue VCs (e.g. via OIDC/SIOP)

## Custodian | For Holders

Custodian is a secure data hub for people and organizations. It provides all functionality required by “Holders”. For example:

* Interact with Registries (read, write)
* Create, store, manage keys, data (DIDs, VCs) and other secrets,
* Request and import data (VCs) from third parties,
* Selectively disclose data (VCs/VPs) for authentication and identification,
* Manage consent and data access in a user-centric fashion.

## Auditor | For Verifiers <a href="#auditor-or-for-verifiers" id="auditor-or-for-verifiers"></a>

Auditor allows you to verify your stakeholders’ identity data and offer frictionless access to services or products. It provides all functionality required by “Verifiers”. For example:

* request data (VCs/VPs) from stakeholders,
* verify data (VCs/VPs; incl. integrity, validity, provenance, authenticity),
* trigger pre-defined actions following the verification.

### **Verification Policies**

The verification steps can be dynamically configured by passing "verification policies" to each verification attempt.&#x20;

The SSI Kit comes with the following set of built-in verification polices:

* **SignaturePolicy**: Loads or resolves DID, loads public key and verifies the credentials signature.
* **JsonSchemaPolicy**: Validates the credential against the JSON schema.
* &#x20;**TrustedSchemaRegistryPolicy**: Checks if the JSON schema is anchored in the EBSI Trusted Schema Registry.
* **TrustedIssuerDidPolicy**: Checks if the issuer DID is anchored on the EBSI DID registry.
* **TrustedIssuerRegistryPolicy**: Checks if the issuer got inserted in the EBSI TIR (Trusted Issuer Registry).
* **TrustedSubjectDidPolicy**: Checks if the issuer DID is anchored on the EBSI DID registry.
* **IssuedDateBeforePolicy**: Checks if issued date is in the past.
* **ValidFromBeforePolicy**: Checks if valid-from date is in the past.
* **ExpirationDateAfterPolicy**: Checks if expiration-date is in the futrue.
* **CredentialStatusPolicy**: Checks if credential is revoked based on the credential-status list.
