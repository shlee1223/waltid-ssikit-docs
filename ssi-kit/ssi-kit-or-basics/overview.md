# Overview

Here are the most important things you need to know about the SSI Kit:

* It is written in **Kotlin/Java**. It can be directly integrated (Maven/Gradle dependency) or run as RESTful web-service. A CLI tool allows you to run all functions manually.
* It is **open source (Apache 2).** You can use the code for free and without strings attached. &#x20;
* It is a holistic solution that allows you to **build** **use cases “end-to-end”.** There is no need to research, combine or tweak different libraries to build pilots or production systems.
* It **abstracts complexity** and low-level functionality via different interfaces (CLI, APIs). Additional services **facilitate development and integration** (e.g. Issuer and Verifier Portals).
* It is **modular, composable and built on open standards** allowing you to customize and extend functionality with your own or third party implementations and to preventing lock-in.&#x20;
* It is **flexible** in a sense that you can deploy and run it on-premise, in your (multi) cloud environment or as a library in your application.&#x20;
* It enables you to **use different identity ecosystems** like Europe’s emerging identity ecosystem ([EBSI, ESSIF](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/ebsi)) in anticipation of a multi-ecosystem future.
