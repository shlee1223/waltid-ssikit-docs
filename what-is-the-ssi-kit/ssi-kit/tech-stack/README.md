# SSI Flavors & Ecosystems

The SSI Kit abstracts complexity for developers by following a "multi-stack approach" that enables you to use different implementations or "flavours" of SSI.

As a result, you can participate in different identity ecosystems (e.g. EBSI/ESSIF, Gaia-X, Velocity Network, cheqd and IOTA) and avoid technology-related lock-in effects.&#x20;

Based on our [Introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)](../../../ssi-kit/ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/), we distinguish the following concepts or building blocks: &#x20;

![Each building block is available in different variations and can be put together in different ways. The result: different "SSI flavours".](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-03-16 at 13.16.32 (1).png>)
