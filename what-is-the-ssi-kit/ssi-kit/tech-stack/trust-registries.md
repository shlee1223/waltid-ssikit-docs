# Trust Registries

Our products are agnostic towards the underlying technologies used to implement Trust Registries, which means that the SSI Kit is potentially compatible with any type of Trust Registry.

The SSI Kit supports:

* Permissionless Blockchains (e.g. Ethereum),
* Permissioned Blockchains (e.g. Ethereum Enterprise/Hyperledger Besu),
* Domain Name Service (DNS),
* Pure peer-to-peer approaches that do not require Registries.

_Note that we are continuously adding support for new Registries and underlying technologies._

&#x20;You can learn more about Trust Registries [here](../../../ssi-kit/ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/technologies-and-concepts/).
