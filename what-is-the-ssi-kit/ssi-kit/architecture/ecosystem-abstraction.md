# Ecosystem Abstraction

We believe in a **multi-ecosystem future**.

This is why we built an abstraction layer for ecosystem-specific operations and business logic. The idea is to support any ecosystem with a single solution that does not put any additional burden on developers. As a result, you can use our solutions to participate in different ecosystems without having to switch between different technical implementations.

We currently support:

* EBSI/ESSIF (EU's new decentralized identity ecosystem)
* Gaia-X (EU's new cloud infrastructure)
* Velocity Network
* cheqd Network
* IOTA

_Note that we are continuously adding new ecosystems._
