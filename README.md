# Introduction

{% hint style="danger" %}
We're redesigning our product stack to make it available for different programming languages and improve the overall developer experience.

We are currently focusing all of our efforts on introducing our new stack, so you won't see as much development activity on the current stack. However, we are still addressing any upcoming issues. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://walt.id/discord).

This documentation will help you understand how the _SSI Kit_ works and how you can use it. However, it presumes a certain level of knowledge about Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) so

* if you are already familiar with SSI, you can jump to the [introduction of the SSI Kit](what-is-the-ssi-kit/ssi-kit/).&#x20;
* if you are new to SSI, please continue with our [introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity](what-is-the-ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/).
