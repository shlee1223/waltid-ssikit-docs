# Introduction

{% hint style="danger" %}
We're redesigning our product stack to make it available for different programming languages and improve the overall developer experience.

We don't add new features to current products, only fixing urgent issues. We try to keep you up to date on anything that might break, but may have missed something. If you encounter any issues, please [reach out](https://walt.id/discord).

This documentation will help you understand how the _SSI Kit_ works and how you can use it. However, it presumes a certain level of knowledge about Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) so

* if you are already familiar with SSI, you can jump to the [introduction of the SSI Kit](what-is-the-ssi-kit/ssi-kit/).&#x20;
* if you are new to SSI, please continue with our [introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity](what-is-the-ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/).
