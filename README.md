### Discontinuation Notice

**Important:** Please be informed that, beginning from December 2023, the SSI Kit will no longer receive new features. Furthermore, the SSI Kit is planned for discontinuation by the end of Q3 2024.\
\
However, all functionalities offered by the SSI Kit will be integrated into our new libraries, APIs, and apps in the walt.id [identity repo](https://github.com/walt-id/waltid-identity). Giving you more modularity, flexibility and ease-of-use to build end-to-end digital identity and wallet solutions.\
\
Read the transition guide [here](ssi-kit/transition-to-the-community-stack.md).\
\
For any clarification or queries, feel free to [contact us](https://walt.id/discord) as we aim to make this transition as smooth as possible.

This documentation will help you understand how the _SSI Kit_ works and how you can use it. However, it presumes a certain level of knowledge about Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) so

* if you are already familiar with SSI, you can jump to the [introduction of the SSI Kit](what-is-the-ssi-kit/ssi-kit/).&#x20;
* if you are new to SSI, please continue with our [introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity](ssi-kit/ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/).
