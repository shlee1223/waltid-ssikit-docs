# Inspection

The verification process (inspection) is initiated by disclosure exchanges where the Relying Party requests credentials from Holder. These exchanges can be encoded in the following ways:

* deep links - a URI that matches the spec:
  * [velocity-network://inspect?request\_uri=\[REQUEST\_URI\]\&inspectorDid=\[INSPECTOR\_DID\]\&vendorOriginContext=\[VENDOR\_ORIGIN\_CONTEXT\]](https://velocity-network/inspect?request_uri=\[REQUEST_URI]\&inspectorDid=\[INSPECTOR_DID]\&vendorOriginContext=\[VENDOR_ORIGIN_CONTEXT])
* QR-codes - a visual representation of a deep link

Depending on the use case, the Relying Party can request either:

* verified credentials
  * requires payment in tokens
  * returns the verification checks (policies) result
* unverified credentials:
  * requires no payment in tokens
  * can be verified later

## Verification policies

The verification checks performed against the credential are the following:

* UNTAMPERED
  * pass - hasn't been tampered
  * fail - has been tampered
  * voucher\_reserve\_exhausted - a voucher is required for verification
* TRUSTED\_ISSUER
  * pass - issuer is trusted
  * fail - issuer is not a member of Velocity
  * self\_signed - data attested by the Holder
  * voucher\_reserve\_exhausted - a voucher is required for verification
* UNREVOKED
  * pass - hasn't been revoked
  * has been revoked
  * voucher\_reserve\_exhausted - a voucher is required for verification
* UNEXPIRED
  * pass - hasn't expired
  * fail - has expired
