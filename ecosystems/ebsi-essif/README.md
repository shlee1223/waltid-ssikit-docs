# EBSI

This section shows how you can use the SSI Kit to interact with Europeâ€™s emerging identity ecosystem based on the

* **EU Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI)**
* **EU Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF)**

[Here](usage-examples/usage-examples.md) \*\*\*\* you can find examples on how to use the SSI Kit command line interface to interact with the EBSI/ESSIF ecosystem.

### State of the EBSI/ESSIF specifications

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note, that some of the flows are not in their final version. Slight modifications are to be expected.
{% endhint %}

### ESSIF DID Registration

Creation and anchoring of a new DID on the EBSI ledger (incl. use of "Verifiable Authorizations" and EBSI access tokens).
