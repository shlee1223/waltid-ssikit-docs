# Demo

The demo shows an end-to-end SSI use case from the perspective of an individual (Holder).

**Issuer Portal:** Shows issuance of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to a Holder’s wallet.

1. Visit our [Issuer Portal](https://issuer.walt.id/).
2. Click on "Sign in". You do not need to input an email or a password.
3. Select and "confirm" your Verifiable Credential (VC) claim.

**Wallet:** Shows the receipt and management of VCs by a Holder.

1. Log into the [Web Wallet](https://wallet.walt.id/) _(after being redirected from the Issuer Portal)._ The demo does not require the account-creation nor a valid passord. Just type a email address to log in you demo account.
2. Accept the connection request (from the Issuer Portal), by clicking on "share".
3. Review and accept the Verifiable Credential (VC).

**Verifier Portal:** Shows the presentation of VCs by Holder in order to authenticate or identify towards a Relying Party (Verifier).
