# Quick Start

{% hint style="danger" %}
We're redesigning our product stack to make it available for different programming languages and improve the overall developer experience.

We don't add new features to current products, only fixing urgent issues. We try to keep you up to date on anything that might break, but may have missed something. If you encounter any issues, please [reach out](https://walt.id/discord).
{% endhint %}

The SSI-Kit's functionality can be used in a variety of ways. Select your preference to get started
